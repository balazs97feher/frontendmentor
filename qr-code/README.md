### Questions for the community
1. Are there any accessibility considerations here other than providing an alt text for the image?
1. Are there other HTML elements that would better convey the semantics of this component?
1. The mobile and desktop designs look pretty much identical to me, I'm guessing it's the first challange. If not, would it be as easy as ussing a few media queries, say for widths below and above 800px?
